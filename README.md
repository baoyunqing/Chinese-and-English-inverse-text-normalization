This code is generally based on Regular Expression and python3

Firstly, creating the values and classes to represent the number related text.
Such as '零一二三四五' --> zero, one, two, three, four, five

Secondly, creating a function to transfer text to number, which is the main function

Finally, transferring different formats of text(date, money, digits, number, fraction)

For the English version, the main logic of the code is similar, but the biggest difference
is that English sentences consist of words rather than characters. And the matching based on
words are more complex because the regex could not tackle with some specific situations.
